After level 3 (Senior Software Engineer), employees are allowed to choose to either go for a technical path or a management path. </p>\n<p>Each job level has some description of what kind of responsibilities are associated with it. I had a pretty good manager who understood my desire to be promoted and he was able to coach me on what management was looking for in a candidate who was nominated for promotion. </p>\n<p>The promotion boiled down being able to demonstrate fulfillment of these areas: </p>\n<p><strong>Technical</strong>\nDo you ship code? Do you take ownership of your team/projects? Can you solve problems? </p>\n<p><strong>Leadership</strong>\nHave you contributed to improving the team? Do you delegate? Have you influenced within and outside of your team? </p>\n<h3>Now and the Future</h3>\n<p>The bump in responsibilities and ownership has been pretty significant and I think there’s a lot of upskilling that would need to take place before my next step. I think the biggest change I’ve felt is that I end up in a lot more meetings and get involved in project decisions now. There’s also been an increase in my sphere of influence in that I am seen as someone who takes responsibility over certain areas of our codebase and I also take part in improving the processes of our group organization which is one step above our team. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Senior Developer","date":"December 24, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/senior-developer/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/code-improvement/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Code Improvement"}},"next":null}}}
