I've been promoted to Senior Software Engineer for about 6 months now and here are some of my thoughts on the journey

### Getting there

Prior to my promotion I'd been working as a Software Engineer for about 2 years and my total experience in the industry was approximately 3.5 years. 
My company has job levels starting at 1 (Associate) going all the way up to 8 (Distinguished Engineer/Senior Director). After level 3 (Senior Software Engineer), employees are allowed to choose to either go for a technical path or a management path. 

Each job level has some description of what kind of responsibilities are associated with it. I had a pretty good manager who understood my desire to be promoted and he was able to coach me on what management was looking for in a candidate who was nominated for promotion. 

The promotion boiled down being able to demonstrate fulfillment of these areas: 

**Technical**
Do you ship code? Do you take ownership of your team/projects? Can you solve problems? 

**Leadership**
Have you contributed to improving the team? Do you delegate? Have you influenced within and outside of your team? 

### Now and the Future

The bump in responsibilities and ownership has been pretty significant and I think there's a lot of upskilling that would need to take place before my next step. I think the biggest change I've felt is that I end up in a lot more meetings and get involved in project decisions now. There's also been an increase in my sphere of influence in that I am seen as someone who takes responsibility over certain areas of our codebase and I also take part in improving the processes of our group organization which is one step above our team.
